Create an API service (you must use Node.js and MongoDB) that supports full
CRUD for your existing CA1 app

Update your existing CA1 app to allow populating the HTML table with JSON data
provided by the API, implement the ability to Add and Delete items from that table
using your new API only from your front-end. You are free to use any available frontend
frameworks/plugins to implement that functionality (Vanilla JavaScript, jQuery,
Angular, etc.)
